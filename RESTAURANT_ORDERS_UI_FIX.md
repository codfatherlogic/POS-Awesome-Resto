# Restaurant Orders UI Fix: Hide Actions for Billed Orders

## Issue Description
In the Restaurant Orders interface, orders with "Billed" status were still showing "Add Items" and "Cancel" buttons, which should not be available for completed/billed orders.

## Root Cause
The `canAddItems()` and `canCancel()` methods in the RestaurantOrders.vue component were checking only the document status (`docstatus`) but not considering the billing status (`per_billed`).

### Previous Logic:
- **canAddItems**: Allowed for any submitted order (`docstatus === 1`) with a table
- **canCancel**: Allowed for any submitted order (`docstatus === 1`)

### Problem:
Orders that were fully billed (`per_billed >= 100`) were still showing these action buttons because they remained in submitted status.

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Logic:
- **canAddItems**: Now excludes fully billed orders (`per_billed < 100`)
- **canCancel**: Now excludes fully billed orders (`per_billed < 100`)

### Code Changes:

#### Before:
```javascript
canCancel(order) {
    return order.docstatus === 1; // Only submitted orders can be cancelled
},

canAddItems(order) {
    // Allow adding items to both draft and submitted orders that have a table (dine-in orders)
    return (order.docstatus === 0 || order.docstatus === 1) && order.table_number;
},
```

#### After:
```javascript
canCancel(order) {
    // Only submitted orders that are not fully billed can be cancelled
    return order.docstatus === 1 && order.per_billed < 100;
},

canAddItems(order) {
    // Allow adding items only to orders that are not fully billed and have a table (dine-in orders)
    // Exclude fully billed orders (per_billed >= 100)
    return (order.docstatus === 0 || order.docstatus === 1) && 
           order.table_number && 
           order.per_billed < 100;
},
```

## Status Determination Logic
The system determines order status using the `getOrderStatus()` method:

```javascript
getOrderStatus(order) {
    if (order.docstatus === 0) return "Draft";
    if (order.docstatus === 1 && order.per_billed < 100) return "Submitted";
    if (order.per_billed >= 100) return "Billed";
    return "Unknown";
}
```

## Actions Available by Status

| Order Status | Edit | Add Items | Reprint KOT | Void Items | Cancel | Delete |
|-------------|------|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|--------|
| **Draft** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Submitted** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Billed** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Logic Summary:
- **Edit**: Only draft orders
- **Add Items**: Draft and submitted orders (with table), but not billed
- **Reprint KOT**: Any order with items (including billed)
- **Void Items**: Only draft orders with items
- **Cancel**: Only submitted orders that are not fully billed
- **Delete**: Only draft orders

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users no longer see irrelevant action buttons for completed orders
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental modifications to completed transactions
3. **Logical Flow**: Actions are only available when they make business sense
4. **Restaurant Workflow**: Aligns with typical restaurant order lifecycle

## Testing

After this fix:
1. Billed orders will only show "Reprint KOT" button (if they have items)
2. "Add Items" and "Cancel" buttons will be hidden for billed orders
3. Other order statuses remain unchanged in their available actions

## Files Modified

- `/frontend/src/posapp/components/pos/RestaurantOrders.vue`
  - Updated `canAddItems()` method
  - Updated `canCancel()` method
