# Restaurant Orders UI Improvements

This update improves the Restaurant Orders interface with better default filtering and appropriate action button visibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Default Status Filter to "Draft"
- **Issue**: Restaurant Orders dialog showed all orders by default, making it cluttered with completed orders
- **Solution**: Set default status filter to "Draft" to show only active orders that need attention
- **Benefit**: Users now see only orders they can work with immediately

### 2. Hide Action Buttons for Billed Orders
- **Issue**: "Add Items" and "Cancel" buttons were visible for completed (Billed) orders
- **Solution**: Updated `canAddItems()` and `canCancel()` methods to exclude billed orders
- **Logic**: Orders with `per_billed >= 100` are considered "Billed" and should not allow modifications

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes - RestaurantOrders.vue

#### Default Filter
```javascript
// Before
filter_status: null,

// After  
filter_status: "Draft", // Default to Draft status
```

#### Action Button Logic
```javascript
// canAddItems method
canAddItems(order) {
    const status = this.getOrderStatus(order);
    return order.docstatus === 1 && status !== "Billed" && status !== "Cancelled";
}

// canCancel method  
canCancel(order) {
    const status = this.getOrderStatus(order);
    return order.docstatus === 1 && status !== "Billed" && status !== "Cancelled";
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Dialog opened showing all orders (Draft, Submitted, Billed, Cancelled)
- Users had to manually filter to find active orders
- "Add Items" and "Cancel" buttons appeared on completed orders
- Cluttered interface with unnecessary actions

### After  
- Dialog opens with only Draft orders by default
- Clean interface focused on actionable orders
- Billed orders show only "Reprint KOT" button (appropriate action)
- Users can still access other statuses via filter dropdown when needed

## Status Filter Options

The status filter dropdown provides these options:
- **Draft**: Orders being prepared (default view)
- **Submitted**: Orders ready for billing
- **Billed**: Completed orders (read-only, KOT reprint only)
- **Cancelled**: Cancelled orders (read-only)

## Button Visibility Matrix

| Order Status | Add Items | Cancel | Reprint KOT | Actions Menu |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Draft       | ✅        | ✅      | ✅          | ✅           |
| Submitted   | ✅        | ✅      | ✅          | ✅           |
| Billed      | ❌        | ❌      | ✅          | ❌           |
| Cancelled   | ❌        | ❌      | ✅          | ❌           |

## Benefits

1. **Focused Workflow**: Users immediately see orders requiring attention
2. **Reduced Errors**: No accidental modifications to completed orders  
3. **Cleaner Interface**: Less visual clutter with appropriate button visibility
4. **Better Performance**: Fewer orders loaded by default (can still access all via filter)
5. **Intuitive UX**: Default view matches most common use case

## Usage

1. **Restaurant Orders Dialog**: Opens with Draft orders by default
2. **Status Filter**: Use dropdown to view other order statuses when needed
3. **Action Buttons**: Only relevant actions are shown for each order status
4. **Workflow**: Draft → Submitted → Billed (with appropriate actions at each stage)

These improvements make the restaurant order management more efficient and user-friendly while preventing accidental modifications to completed orders.
